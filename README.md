# AQ_Fetch

## Project Structure:

My submission only has two view controllers, one that contains the search bar with a table view to display results. The other 
is a static table view that displays an event's relevant information. I decided to use a static table view to give the screen more structure 
and to allow for easy auto layout. Lastly, I save a user's events by only saving the event ID. In the table view, I iterate through the saved Core data objects and if 
an event's ID has been saved, it fills the heart, otherwise it doesn't.

## Requirements:

My submission satisfies all requirements expect the support of iOS 12 and testing. I recently graduated in May. Unfortunately, I was never taught how
to create tests or how to support other versions of iOS. Of course I am willing and excited to learn these things. I just thought for my submission it would be 
best to have a working version for iOS 13 and above. 

## Improvements:

Overall, I was able to display an event's relevant information. I think for a future iteration, I would focus on adding higher quality images to the details and results
table view. In addition, I would look into saving the events as custom objects in core data. Right now, I simply save the events ID. This way, users will be 
able to see an entire event that was saved, rather than just its ID. 

## Conclusion:
Overall, I really enjoyed coding this project. I am a recent graudate passionate about iOS development, and I am looking for a chance to start my career. I would love 
to do that at a place like Fetch! Thank you!
